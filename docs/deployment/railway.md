## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have:

!!! tip "First time with Railway?"
    No worries! We'll walk through everything step by step.

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Install Railway CLI

=== "macOS/Linux"
    ```bash
    # Install via npm (requires Node.js 16+)
    npm install -g @railway/cli
    
    # Verify installation
    railway --version
    ```

=== "Windows"
    ```powershell
    # Install via npm
    npm install -g @railway/cli
    
    # Verify installation
    railway --version
    ```

### Step 2: Login to Railway

```bash
# This opens your browser for authentication
railway login
```

**‚úÖ Success indicator**: You'll see "Logged in as [your-email]"

### Step 3: Create Your Railway Project

Navigate to your Wappa project directory and initialize:

```bash
# In your project directory (e.g., wappa_full_example/)
cd your-wappa-project

# Initialize Railway project
railway init

# Select "Create new project"
# Choose a memorable project name (e.g., "my-whatsapp-app")
```

**‚úÖ Success indicator**: You'll see "Project created: [project-name]"

### Step 4: Add Redis Service

Your conversational app needs Redis for state management. Railway makes this trivial:

```bash
# Add Redis with one command
railway add redis
```

**‚úÖ Success indicator**: Redis service appears in your Railway dashboard

!!! info "Redis URL Magic"
    Railway automatically creates the `REDIS_URL` environment variable as `redis://redis.railway.internal:6379`. No manual configuration needed!

### Step 5: Deploy Your Application

Here's where the magic happens:

```bash
# Deploy to Railway
railway up
```

Railway will:
- üîç Detect your `Dockerfile`
- üèóÔ∏è Build your container 
- üöÄ Deploy to production infrastructure
- üåê Generate your public URL

**‚úÖ Success indicator**: You'll see "Deployment successful" with your app URL

### Step 6: Configure Environment Variables

Set your WhatsApp credentials in Railway:

```bash
# Set WhatsApp Business API credentials
railway variables set WP_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token_here
railway variables set WP_PHONE_ID=your_phone_number_id_here  
railway variables set WP_BID=your_business_id_here
railway variables set WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN=your_webhook_token_here
```

!!! tip "Dashboard Alternative"
    Prefer a visual interface? Set variables in Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Your Service ‚Üí Variables tab.

The Redis URL is automatically configured as:
```bash
REDIS_URL=redis://redis.railway.internal:6379
```

### Step 7: Configure WhatsApp Webhook

Now connect WhatsApp to your deployed app:

1. **Get your Railway URL** from the dashboard or CLI:
   ```bash
   railway status
   ```

2. **Configure webhook in Meta for Developers**:
   - Webhook URL: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/webhook/messenger/YOUR_PHONE_ID/whatsapp`
   - Verify Token: `your_webhook_token_here`

3. **Test your webhook**:
   ```bash
   curl "https://your-app.up.railway.app/health"
   ```

**‚úÖ Success indicator**: Health check returns 200 OK

## üéâ Your Conversational App is Live!

**Congratulations!** Your Wappa application is now running on production infrastructure with:

- **‚úÖ Automatic scaling** - Handles traffic spikes
- **‚úÖ SSL certificate** - Secure HTTPS by default  
- **‚úÖ Redis caching** - Fast state management
- **‚úÖ Global CDN** - Fast worldwide response
- **‚úÖ Health monitoring** - Automatic issue detection

### Test Your Deployment

Send a test message to your WhatsApp Business number. You should see:

1. **Echo response** - Your message echoed back
2. **Interactive commands** - Try `/button` or `/list`
3. **Logs in Railway** - Check Railway dashboard ‚Üí Logs tab

## üîß Managing Your Deployment

### View Real-Time Logs

```bash
# Follow logs in real-time
railway logs

# Or view in Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments ‚Üí View Logs
```

### Update Your App

Made changes? Deploy updates instantly:

```bash
# Deploy latest changes
railway up
```

### Add Custom Domain (Optional)

```bash
# Add your custom domain
railway domain add yourdomain.com

# Or via Railway Dashboard ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Domains
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

**Problem**: Deployment fails during build
```bash
# Check build logs
railway logs --deployment

# Common solutions:
# ‚Ä¢ Ensure Dockerfile exists in project root
# ‚Ä¢ Verify uv.lock file is present
# ‚Ä¢ Check Python version compatibility (3.12+)
```

### Environment Variable Issues

**Problem**: App starts but doesn't work
```bash
# List current variables
railway variables

# Check for missing required variables:
# WP_ACCESS_TOKEN, WP_PHONE_ID, WP_BID, WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_VERIFY_TOKEN
```

### Redis Connection Problems

**Problem**: Cache-related errors in logs
```bash
# Verify Redis service exists
railway status

# Check Redis URL format
railway variables get REDIS_URL
# Should be: redis://redis.railway.internal:6379
```

### Webhook Not Responding

**Problem**: WhatsApp messages not reaching your app

1. **Verify webhook URL format**:
   ```
   https://your-app.up.railway.app/webhook/messenger/YOUR_PHONE_ID/whatsapp
   ```

2. **Test webhook endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "https://your-app.up.railway.app/webhook/messenger/YOUR_PHONE_ID/whatsapp?hub.verify_token=YOUR_TOKEN&hub.challenge=test"
   ```

3. **Check WhatsApp Business API settings** in Meta for Developers

## üí° Pro Tips

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Pull production environment for local development
railway run -- uv run python -m app.main

# This runs your local app with production environment variables
```

### Monitoring

```bash
# Check deployment status
railway status

# View application metrics in Railway Dashboard
# Monitor Redis usage and performance
```

### Scaling

Railway automatically scales based on traffic, but you can configure:

- **Vertical scaling** - More CPU/memory per instance
- **Horizontal scaling** - More instances (Pro plan required)
- **Auto-sleep** - Saves costs by sleeping during low traffic
