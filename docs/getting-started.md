## What Wappa Does

Wappa is an open-source Python framework that makes building WhatsApp Business applications simple:

```python
from wappa import Wappa, WappaEventHandler

class MyApp(WappaEventHandler):
    async def handle_message(self, message):
        await self.messenger.send_text(f"Hello {message.sender_name}!", message.sender_phone)

app = Wappa(
    whatsapp_token="your_token",
    whatsapp_phone_id="your_phone_id", 
    whatsapp_business_id="your_business_id"
)
app.register_handler(MyApp())
```

**That's it.** Three things: handle messages, send responses, register your handler.
